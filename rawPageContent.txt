what this is for - This tool is only for analysis of quality of a gpx and inturn the device that was used for it. this doesnt give a score for it this doesnt give predicitons or derive conclusions, but lets u drive ur own conclusions. this is for observation only and no repurposing
constraints - best usecase for raw gpx files, not merged and not pre-processed. they wud introduce invariants that this system does not account for and will only after studying bad gpx data from x reasons like export fault, faulty merging, pre-processed gpx trends etc.

the system will tell about most relevant data there is in the gpx file, like total number of points found etc. only raise flags as counters about what is objectively wrong in the gpx such as point to point comparison backtrack of time or equal timestamps, how many points were discarded because of x reason.
that is another constraint, sometimes during export or writing of gpx file, there can be mismatch of timestamps or ordering or even mislogging of the timestamp during activity. big segments of a gpx being timestamped is something that has not been observed by me yet in a raw gpx. it usually occurs in merged files that were combined in incorrect order manually. taking that into assumtion backtracking flags are only done for consecutive 1 to 1 point comparisons only. 

coordinate validation is done at ingestion only and points are rejected then and there. 
next a timestamp audit is run to check once for a rare occurance of timestmaps not being in order. again there is no reordering or mutation of gpx, just observing and flaggin unintentional variation.

the pipeline - the pipeline is not linear in terms of data processing cause, this is not a processing pipeline. processing is only done locally for each module with the exception of rejecting invalid coordinates because they are the only fundamental block of a gpx without which any other data becomes meaningless. 
             - currently the only mutation upstream happens directly at ingestion that is filtering for valid coords. all the audits, be it timestamped audit or sampling audit for graph viz take the data frmo the ingestion pipeline after valid coords filtering. there is no other mutation happening in the pipeline elsewhere cause that wud be assumptious. invalid timestamps are just flagged in the timestmap audit not mutated because this is an observation only pipeline and timestamps do not fall in the absolute necessary data category.
